# NFT
Creating and minting an NFT using tools like HardHat for smart contract, OpenZeppelin for security, NodeJS, and JavaScript

**Steps Taken**:

1) Installed Metamask plugin for browser in order to have access to an Ethereum address for our smart contract

2) Used Node-as-a-Service provider Alchemy to run and maintain the infrastructure for our Ethereum node

3) Initialized a NodeJS project for our NFT project

4) Created another directory called ethereum in the main NFT project and initialized it as a HardHat project to test and deploy our ethereum software

5) Intialize our .env variables to store our Alchemy key, Metamask private key and address, and make sure to add the file to our .gitignore file

6) Installed and used OpenZeppelin to take advantage of the smart contract development features

7) Built the Metadata for the NFT by using an API endpoint which resolved in our NFT's information as a JSON file

8) Exposed the Metadata created earlier to a publicily accessable URL using ngrok

9) Deployed, viewed, and the minted my NFT
